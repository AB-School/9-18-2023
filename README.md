### Information

Today we learned about shapes, well not shapes
but, how to code to create shapes using the
tools rasbery pi gave us. We used Mu since
replit didn't like what I inputed so, I couldn't really
do anything about that...

We then looked at the old computers and the old games
which were text based. One of these known as the oregon trail
was the most recognizable for me in general.

### Coding

I also did some coding to create a rectangle:

from shapes import Paper, Triangle, Oval, Rectangle

paper = Paper()

rect1 = Rectangle()

rect1.set_color("blue")
rect1.set_height(100)
rect1.set_width(200)



rect1.draw()

paper.display()

-------------

### Code from today

from shapes import Paper, Triangle, Oval, Rectangle

paper = Paper()

rect1 = Rectangle()

rect1.set_color("blue")
rect1.set_height(100)
rect1.set_width(200)
rect1.set_x(200)
rect1.set_y(200)

oval1 = Oval()


oval1.set_x(250)
oval1.set_y(200)
oval1.set_height(100)
oval1.set_width(100)
oval1.set_color("red")

tri1 = Triangle()

tri1.set_x(300)
tri1.set_y(150)
tri1.set_x(300)
tri1.set_y(150)
tri1.set_color("yellow")

###Coding

Mainly today was just spent coding... nothing much really. I made a rectangle, and a oval. Then spent for god knows how long to make a TRIANGLE, a single TRIANGLE and I didn't even learn how to because, it doesn't explain it in the video's or the code! So, you could imagine i was a bit mad.

Code Command Prompts:
rect1.draw()
tri1.draw() (This doesn't want to work because i have to set MULTIPLE x's and it won't let me so thats great!)
oval1.draw()

###Coding again, the pain of triangles...

So, we are back at it again learning how to do traingles!
Setting x2 to be something doesn't work or doing 2x so thats fun! I'm having a great time... this takes so, long to experiment with.
For the most part besides making some small patterns with ovals and rectangles I was experencing suffering due to the god dang triangles!
